//! This module defines a framework for using the crate::expectations module in
//! asynchronous situations, where you wish you detect the satisfiability of the
//! expectations at some undetermined point in the future.
//!
//! An `ExpectationFuture` implements `Future` and will complete when the
//! underlying state satisfies the predicate. Failure can be detected by wrapping
//! the future in a timeout, as is implemented by the method `when_satisfied`.
//!
//! To use `ExpectationFuture`s, you must implement `ExpectableState` for the
//! type of state you wish to track, which defines how the state will update and
//! notify tasks that are waiting on state changes.
//!
//! A common pattern is to await the expectation of a given state, and then
//! check further predicate expectations to determine success or failure at that
//! point in time.
//!
//! e.g.
//!
//!   ```ignore
//!   // Wait for the action to have completed one way or the other
//!   let state = await!(state.when_satisfied(action_complete, timeout))?;
//!   // Then check that the action completed successfully
//!   action_success.satisfied(state)
//!   ```
